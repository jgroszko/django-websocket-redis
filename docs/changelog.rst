Release History
===============

0.4.7
-----
Improvements to the javascript API:

* Performing reconnection attempts when the first connection (on instantiation) fails.
* Adding the 'close()' method to enable closing the connection explicitly. When the connection is
  closed calling this method, there will be no reconnection attempts. In order to connect again,
  the client must be re-instantiated.
* Adding 'connecting' and 'disconnected' callback options. The first is fired right before the
  Websocket is being instantiated, while tha last is fired after connection is closed.
* Adding the following methods to check websocket status: ``is_connecting()``, ``is_connected()``,
  ``is_closing()``, ``is_closed()``.
* Replaced ``STATIC_URL`` against ``{% static %}`` in all templates.
* Keep track on opened websockets.

0.4.6
-----
* Added support for the Sec-WebSocket-Protocol header. Thanks to Erwin Junge.
* Fixed bug in unpacking binary websocket protocol.

0.4.5
-----
* created 1 requirements file under ``examples/chatserver/requirements.txt``
* renamed chatclient.py to test_chatclient.py - for django-nose testrunner
* migrated example project to django 1.7
* edited ``docs/testing.rst`` to show new changes for using example project

0.4.4
-----
* Added method ``release()`` to ``RedisSubscriber`` and calling this method each time a Websocket
  closes, for whatever reason. This should avoid some reported memory issues.

0.4.3
-----
* Fixed: **django-websocket-redis** failed to initialize under some circumstances in combination
  with Django-1.7. This only happened for logged in users and threw this exception:
  ``django.core.exceptions.AppRegistryNotReady: Models aren't loaded yet.``
* Added setup on how to run **django-websocket-redis** with uWSGI but without NGiNX.

0.4.2
-----
* Message echoing can be switched “on” and “off” according to the user needs. Before it was “on”
  by default.
* Many changes to get this app compatible with Python3. This is still not finished, since the
  pilfered module ``websocket.py`` is not PY3 compatible yet.
* Added a class ``RedisMessage`` to pass and store the message to and from the websocket.
  Before this was just a string with serialized data.

0.4.1
-----
* Fixed: ``request.user.username`` has been replaced by ``get_username()``.

0.4.0
-----
* Messages can be sent to users being member of one or more Django groups.
* ``RedisPublisher`` and ``RedisSubscriber`` now only accept lists for ``users``, ``groups`` and 
  ``sessions``. This makes the API simpler and more consistent.
* A new magic item ``ws4redis.redis_store.SELF`` has been added to reflect self referencing in
  this list, what before was done through ``users=True`` or ``sessions=True``.
* Added the possibility to receive heartbeats. This lets the client disconnect and attempt to
  reconnect after a number of heartbeats were missed. It prevents silent disconnections.
* Refactored the examples.
* Added reusable JavaScript code for the client.
* Added a context processor to inject some settings from ``ws4redis`` into templates.

0.3.1
-----
* Keys for entries in Redis datastore can be prefixed by an optional string. This may be required
  to avoid namespace clashes.

0.3.0
----- 
* Added possibility to publish and subscribe for Django Groups, additionally to Users and Sesions.
* To ease the communication between Redis and the Django, a new class ``RedisPublisher`` has
  been added as Programming Interface for the Django loop. Before, one had to connect to the Redis
  datastore directly to send messages to the Websoclet loop.
* Renamed configuration setting ``WS4REDIS_STORE`` to ``WS4REDIS_SUBSCRIBER``.

0.2.3
-----
* Fixed: Use flush to discard received PONG message.

0.2.2
-----
* Moved mokey patching for Redis socket into the runner. This sometimes caused errors when
  running in development mode.
* Added timeout to select call. This caused IOerrors when running under uWSGI and the websocket
  was idle.

0.2.1
-----
* Reverted issue #1 and dropped compatibility with Django-1.4 since the response status must
  use force_str.

0.2.0
-----
* Major API changes.
* Use ``WS4REDIS_...`` in Django settings.
* Persist messages, allowing server reboots and reconnecting the client.
* Share the file descriptor for Redis for all open connections.
* Allow to override the subscribe/publish engine.

0.1.2
-----
* Fixed: Can use publish to websocket without subscribing.

0.1.1
-----
* Instead of CLI monkey patching, explicitly patch the redis.connection.socket using
  ``gevent.socket``.

0.1.0
-----
* Initial revision.
